# PracticeApp
Android app: a no-frills app that shows access to a lot of the Android phone service systems within the app itself, such as making a phone call, setting a timer reminder, opening a brownser with scroll and zoom, view address book, finding a location and my own location, read and send SMS. Built using Eclipse.
